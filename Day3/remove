===delete
	==deleteOne() :Deletes a single document that matches the specified filter.
		db.collection.deleteOne(
		   <filter>,
		   {
		      writeConcern: <document>,
		      collation: <document>
		   }
		)
	==deleteMany:Deletes all documents that match the specified filter.
		db.collection.deleteMany(
		   <filter>,
		   {
		      writeConcern: <document>,
		      collation: <document>
		   }
		)
	==remove():deprecated but still works. It can delete one or many documents.
		// Delete one document (equivalent to deleteOne)
		db.users.remove({ status: "inactive" }, { justOne: true })

		// Delete multiple documents (equivalent to deleteMany)
		db.users.remove({ status: "temporary" })
	==Deleting All Documents
		db.collection.deleteMany({}) // Empty filter matches all documents
		//To completely remove a collection (including all documents and
		 indexes):
		 db.collection.drop()
