data categories
	Structured
		predefined schema
		Tabular format with fixed columns
		Strongly typed data elements
		Relationships enforced through keys
		Examples:Relational database tables (SQL),Spreadsheets,Financial transaction
	Semi-Structured Data
		Flexible schema
		Self-describing (contains metadata/tags)
		Hierarchical organization
		Partial organization with some structure
		Examples:
			JSON/XML documents
			NoSQL databases (MongoDB)
			Email messages (structured headers + unstructured body)
			Log files with some consistent fields
	Unstructured Data
		No predefined data model
		No inherent organization
		Typically text-heavy but can be binary
		Difficult to analyze without processing

		Examples:
			Text documents (Word, PDF)

			Multimedia files (images, videos)

			Social media posts

			Sensor data streams

			Scientific datasets
Modern Hybrid Approaches:
	PostgreSQL with JSONB columns (SQL + document)

	MongoDB with strict schema validation

	Data lakes that store all types with metadata

	Search engines (Elasticsearch) that index unstructured content
====================================
Big data
	volume --->data volum big
	velocity---> (instgram & facebook & iot devices)
	varity---> (in relation db must alter table and allow null)
	
		
why nosql
	realational db in join with zeta size (data everywhere) very slow 
	data store in hard disk but query processing in memery
	so in zeta size (imagin memory size can handel join)
	-no join
	-no nulls
	-no schema
	-no relation
